Please note that these applications do not open directly.
You have to copy the main code into a new application.
Then you have to either copy the driver codes into the main files or add solutions.
This can be done by right clicking the solution name in Solution Esplorer on right side of the screen and then clicking on 'Add'.
This has 2 options - 'New item' and 'Existing item'.
Copy the code into 'New item' or save the code in a new file and copy the link via 'Existing item'.
Further, the *.c code has to be copied into correspondng *.h file.
Further, ADC_REFSEL_VCC_gc has to be changed to ADC_REFSEL_INTVCC_gc.
And ADC_CH_GAINFAC_t to ADC_CH_GAIN_1X_gc or other multipliers.
This is because ADC_REFSEL_VCC_gc and ADC_CH_GAINFAC_t no longer exist.
Then build and enjoy.
